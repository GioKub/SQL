1. Grouping and sorting (WRONG!)

SELECT class, SUM(student) AS count FROM Student_in_class GROUP BY class ORDER BY count DESC

2. Aggregation functions MIN and MAX

SELECT status, MIN(birthday) AS birthday FROM FamilyMembers GROUP BY status

3.Aggregation function AVG

SELECT plane, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(second, time_out, time_in)) AS time FROM Trip GROUP BY plane

4. SELECTing using multiple aggregation functions

SELECT room_id, COUNT(user_id) AS count, AVG(price) AS avg_price FROM Reservations GROUP BY room_id ORDER BY count DESC, avg_price DESC

5. HAVING

SELECT room_id, COUNT(user_id) AS count, AVG(price) AS avg_price FROM Reservations GROUP BY room_id HAVING avg_price > 150 ORDER BY count DESC, avg_price DESC
